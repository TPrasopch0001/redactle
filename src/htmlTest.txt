<h1>Gundam (fictional robot)</h1>
<h2>Conception and design</h2>
<p>The RX-78's initial concept was that of a powered armor, the primary design for Yoshiyuki Tomino's proposed series Freedom Fighter Gunboy. The series later changed its name to Mobile Suit Gundam and Kunio Okawara was given Tomino's concept to shape into a finalized design for the anime. Okawara created multiple designs before settling on the current, samurai-styled design for the anime in 1979.
Enemies in the series regularly refer to the RX-78-2 as the white suit or the White Devil (due to the suit's formidable battle performance) while it is a mix of blue, red, and white. Tomino's response in the novel version of Gundam is that the original design was to be a grayscale machine, made up of mostly white and light gray colouring. However, Sunrise disapproved of the colouring and insisted the unit to be painted in brighter colours like other super robot anime at that time.
The Japan Self-Defense Forces built an approximately full scale RX-78-3 Gundam (named after the use of helium-3 fuel) with styrofoam in its show and contains a simulation pod.</p>

As part of the 30th Anniversary of the Gundam series, the company officially announced a project on March 11, 2009, called Real-G planning to build a 1:1 real size scale Gundam in Japan. It was completed on June 9, 2009, and displayed in a Tokyo park. The 18-meter tall statue was later moved and reconstructed in Shizuoka City, where it stayed from July 2010 to March 2011. This design became the basis for the Real Grade model in 2010 and the Master Grade Ver.3.0 model in 2013 and makes an appearance in Model Suit Gunpla Builders Beginning G.
