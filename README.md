# Redactle in Python

This is my attempt at recreating the [Redactle Game](https://redactle.net) using Python.

## Requirements/Dependencies

The program was written using Python 3.13.5

You need to install the following python libraries

> tkinter
> 
> tkinterweb
> 
> requests
> 
> bs4
> 
> markdown

You can install these libraries through pip

## How To Play

The scrollable text is based on a random wikipedia page. The goal of the game is to figure out the wikipedia page's topic. This can range from people to events or locations. However, most of the text is hidden! In order to figure out the topic, you need to guess words that might be in the article

## Work In Progress

- User Input
- UI Improvements
- Optimize Wiki Page Randomizer
